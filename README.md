Completed as part of the OANDA Hachathon Dec 10/2013.

This hack was to create a Backtester (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtesting) for algorithmic foreign exchange trading.

The Forex rates are taken from the OANDA dev API.

A web interface is provided that allows input of a trading strategy (in python), which is the tested againts 8 months of rates.

The results are then graphed.
